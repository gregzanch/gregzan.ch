## CURRENT PROJECTS
### CRAM
ðŸ”— [cram.vercel.app](cram.vercel.app) - [source](github.com/gregzanch/cram)

Developed a web-based acoustic simulation engine that creates room impulse responses from a 3d mesh. Designed the interface to maximize usability, scalability, and extensibility. Leveraged TypeScript for strict type checking and utilized modern web technologies and frameworks including WebGL, React, and WebWorkers.

### Beam-Vibrations
ðŸ”— [beam-vibrations-gregzanch.vercel.app](github.com/gregzanch/beam-vibrations) - [source](github.com/gregzanch/beam-vibrations)

Developed an interactive 3D web application that simulates transverse vibrations along a cantilevered beam given a user-defined position/velocity function. Implemented state persistence using local storage.

### Alpha-DB
ðŸ”— [source](github.com/gregzanch/alpha-db)

Created a REST API and web application for searching a MongoDB database of acoustic materials. Implemented a fuzzy search algorithm with configurable typo tolerance. Deployed the application in an AWS EC2 container. 

### nplot
ðŸ”— [source/api](https://github.com/gregzanch/nplot-api) - [source/client](https://github.com/gregzanch/nplot-client)

Engineered a language-agnostic data visualization application. Designed the application architecture as an electron app that opens a local server and listens for incoming requests.

### Motion
ðŸ”— [source](https://github.com/gregzanch/motion)

Developed a command-line application that allows users to create SVG animations using a JSON schema.
